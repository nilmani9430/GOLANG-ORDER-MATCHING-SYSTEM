## ‚öôÔ∏è Instructions for running the Docker Image

### 1.  Environment Variables
üîñ Note:
If you don‚Äôt want to use your own .env file, the Docker image will use inbuilt environment variables for testing purposes.
However, if you prefer to use your custom .env file, you can do so by mounting it when running the container<br><br>
Make sure to set the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
DB_HOST = ""
DB_PORT = ""
DB_USER = ""
DB_PASSWORD = ""
DB_NAME = ""
```
### 2. Spin the container with image

#### Image name - codeblooded9/golang-order-matching-system

Run below command if you want to use your custom `.env` file 
```bash
docker run -it --env-file=.env -p 8080:8080 codeblooded9/golang-order-matching-system
```

Run below command if you want to go with predefined enviroment variables for testing purpose
```bash
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 codeblooded9/golang-order-matching-system
```
### 3. Use the Postman API documentation to test the endpoints
